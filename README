1. generate symbolic link for qualnet 
ln -s ../tm/multihop-mimo/3.9.5/bin/qualnet qualnet-MIMO
ln -s ../3.9.5/bin/qualnet-MORE qualnet-MORE
ln -s ../3.9.5.PRO/bin/qualnet qualnet-OUR2
ln -s ../qualnet_binary/qualnet-spp qualnet-spp

2. compile tools:
  1) perflow
      > cd perflow
      > make
  2) upperbound
      > cd upperbound
      > make

3. for first time, set $measureOneHop = 1 in run-debug.pl and run it: perl run-debug.pl > /dev/null

Note: 
- ConflictGraph-sigcomm-camera-ready
  compile error, so I check in executable file as well

- files:
  composite.txt: a list of composite link in the order of composite link Id starting from 0. Format: flow:sender_lst:receiver_lst
  weightFile: flow power rate compositeLinkId weight
  creditFile: nodeId power rate flow compositeLinkId 1 1 sent received sent-interval redundancy
  credit = weight * redundancy

- process results:
1) cp summary* into the following dirs:
  throughput:
  results/grid-6Mbps-dist100-mac1/r1
  results/grid-6Mbps-dist100-mac0/r1
  results/rand-6Mbps-dist100-mac1/r1
  results/rand-6Mbps-dist100-mac0/r1
  proportional fairness:
  results/grid-6Mbps-dist100-mac1/r3
  results/grid-6Mbps-dist100-mac0/r3
  results/rand-6Mbps-dist100-mac1/r3
  results/rand-6Mbps-dist100-mac0/r3
2) perl run-process-results.pl results/grid-6Mbps-dist100-mac1/r1 (or other dirs) 
3) In run-gen-plot.gpl: edit $obj, $topo, $mac to generate the figures you have results for, and then run "perl run-gen-plot.gpl > plot.gpl"
4) gnuplot < plot.gpl

To process proportional fairness results, just change "if (0)" to "if (1)" in run-process-summary.pl and edit run-gen-plot.gpl to $obj = 3 and run both scripts.
